# Exploring Football Players in FIFA 19

![A screenshot of your application. Could be a GIF.](screenshot.png)


Association football (soccer) is undeniably the most popular sport in the world. In this project, we create interactive 
visualizations that enable users to explore a dataset of players from <i>FIFA 19</i>, a football simulation video game. By 
interacting with our visualizations, users can learn about the attributes that make up a valuable football player, the 
correlations between player attributes (e.g. sport-specific skills, general measures of athletic ability, etc.), and how
players from different countries around the world compare. More detail on these, along with specific sample questions, 
are provided in the Project Goals section below.

## Project Goals

TODO: **A clear description of the goals of your project.** Describe the question that you are enabling a user to answer. The question should be compelling and the solution should be focused on helping users achieve their goals.Â 

## Design

TODO: **A rationale for your design decisions.** How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?

## Development

TODO: **An overview of your development process.** Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?
